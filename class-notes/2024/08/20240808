	Constructor: is a special member function/method whose task is to
	             initialize the objects of a class. The function is
	             special because its name and that of the class is
	             same.
	             
	             1. Constructors are always defined in the public
	                section.
	             2. Constructors does not anything not even void.
	             3. Constructors are automatically called when an
	                object of the class is created.
	                
	If an explicit constructor is not defined the compiler supplies a
	default constructor implicitly, which is of the form:
		period::period()
		{
		}
	
	And if a constructor is explictly defined compiler will not supply
	the default constructor.
