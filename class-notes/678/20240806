 Encapsulation: The wrapping up of data and function(method) into a
                single unit (called class).
                
                
 Object has properties (data) and behavior (methods)
 
 Ojects are the basic runtime entities in an object oriented system.
 They may represent a person, place, a bank account etc.
 
 Object are variable of class type.
 
 Object are value-types.
 
 Types of variables:
 	Value type			:	Stores actual data (int, float, char)
 	Reference type		:   Stores addresses (pointer)
 	
 Variables can be created either statically or dynamically.
 Statically:
 	int a;
 	float b;
 	int nums[10];
 
 Dynamically:
 	int *a = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));			//C
 	int *nums = (int*)calloc(n, sizeof(int));	//C
 	
 	FILE *fp;									//C
 
 	int *a = new int;							//C++
 	Integer a = new Integer();					//Java
 	
 Routine is a collection of periods.
