		Analysis (What is the problem?)
			- Problem statement
			
			
	
	In the region where I am staying there are a number libraries.
	Some of them are integrated with an educational institute like
	school, colleges etc. The are some which are independent run by
	private people/organisation. Most of them are still using the 
	tradition pen-paper method for keep records. We know that pen-paper
	based record keeping process is slow and in-efficient. Moreover, it
	fails to cater usefully to todays tech-savvy readers.
	
	In order to take care of the above mention issues, we may develop
	a customised software.
